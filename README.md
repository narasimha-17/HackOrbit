# HackOrbit

Overview
Our project is an AI-driven medical assistant that analyzes uploaded medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) and symptom descriptions (typed or spoken) to provide a comprehensive clinical interpretation — including diagnosis, recommendations, and a visual mind map for better understanding.

Core Features
• Voice-to-Text Symptoms: Allows patients to describe symptoms using voice — especially useful in rural/elderly populations
• Diagnosis with Recommendations: Provides a detailed diagnosis, tests to be conducted, treatment advice, and ethical guidance
• Medical Image Interpretation: Uploads and processes PNG/JPEG medical images with expert-style clinical feedback.

Problem It Solves
Many patients and rural health workers struggle to understand medical scans or explain symptoms clearly — leading to delayed diagnosis, misinterpretation, and overburdened doctors. Our tool bridges this communication and diagnostic gap using AI — enhancing clarity, efficiency, and reach of healthcare.

Use Cases
• Rural Telemedicine: Patients with limited access to doctors can self-submit images + voice input.
• Clinical Decision Support: Helps junior doctors or medical interns in image-based diagnostics.
• Medical Education: Mind maps assist in learning differential diagnoses and pathologies.
• Home Healthcare: Elderly users can use speech input to get AI-generated advice on conditions.
